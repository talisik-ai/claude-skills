  Lead skill for sprint-start context health checks. Reads a module's context MD

  report with CLEAN / STALE / OUTDATED status and a copy-paste ready CONTEXT-HEALTH.md row.

# Context Audit Skill

You are the Lead's sprint-start audit tool. Your job is to compare a module's context MD against the actual codebase and surface every divergence — nothing slips past you.

Run this at the start of every sprint, for every module that will be touched. A stale context MD loaded into a developer session is worse than no context MD at all.

---

## Input

The user provides a module name or context MD path. Examples:
- `auth` → resolve to `docs/context/auth.context.md`
- `docs/context/billing.context.md` → use directly
- `auth.context.md` → use directly

**Resolution order (try in sequence until found):**
1. `docs/context/[module].context.md`
2. `[module].context.md`
3. `docs/[module].context.md`

If none found, stop: "Context MD not found. Please provide the exact file path."

---

## Pre-flight Checks

Before running the audit:

1. **Confirm context MD exists** — if not found after resolution, stop and ask.
2. **Confirm module directory exists** — warn if it can't be determined from "Key Files" paths.
3. **Check for `CONTEXT-HEALTH.md`** in project root — if missing, note it at the end and offer a starter template.

---

## The 5 Checks

Run all 5 checks. Do not stop at the first failure — collect all findings, then produce the report.

### Check 1 — Missing Files

Read every file listed under "## Key Files" in the context MD.
For each: does the file exist in the repo?

Flag any that are missing. These were once key files and have been deleted, renamed, or moved — the context MD doesn't know yet.

### Check 2 — Untracked Files

Read the module directory (infer it from the directory prefix of "Key Files" entries).
List all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.go`, `.java`, `.rs` files in the module.
Exclude: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.d.ts`.

Flag any file not listed in "Key Files". New significant files suggest the module has grown beyond what the context MD documents.

### Check 3 — Dependency Drift

Read the import statements in each "Key Files" entry that exists.
Cross-reference against the "## Dependencies" section of the context MD.

Flag any package or internal module that appears in imports but is not listed in "Dependencies". This indicates the module now relies on something the context MD doesn't mention.

### Check 4 — Pattern Drift

Read the "## Required Patterns" section of the context MD.
Scan the actual module files for evidence of each pattern.

Examples:
- Pattern says "always use React Query" → look for `useQuery`/`useMutation` imports
- Pattern says "use Zod for validation" → look for `z.` or `import { z }`
- Pattern says "repository layer only" → look for direct Prisma calls in route files

Flag patterns that are listed as required but show no evidence of use in the actual code. Note this is best-effort — add "limited scan" disclaimer if the module is large (10+ files).

### Check 5 — Staleness

Read the `last_verified_sprint` field from the context MD frontmatter or header.
Compare to the current sprint (ask the user for the current sprint if not provided in the conversation).

- Same sprint → PASS
- 1 sprint old → PASS with note
- 2+ sprints old → FAIL — flag exact gap

## Output Format

```
## Context Audit — [module-name].context.md
Audited: [today's date]
Sprint: [current sprint, or "unknown — please specify"]

**Status: CLEAN ✅ / STALE ⚠️ / OUTDATED ❌**

---

### Check 1 — Missing Files
[PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌]
[If FAIL:]
  - `[path/to/file.ts]` — listed in Key Files, not found in repo

### Check 2 — Untracked Files
[PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌]
[If FAIL:]
  - `[path/to/new-file.ts]` — found in module, not listed in Key Files

### Check 3 — Dependency Drift
[PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌]
[If FAIL:]
  - `[package-name]` — imported in [file.ts] but not listed in Dependencies

### Check 4 — Pattern Drift
[PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌ / LIMITED ⚠️]
[If FAIL:]
  - "[pattern name]" — listed as required, no evidence found in module files
[If LIMITED:]
  - Scan was limited (large module). Manual verification recommended.

### Check 5 — Staleness
[PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌]
[If FAIL:]
  - last_verified_sprint: Sprint-XX ([N] sprints ago) — update required

---

### Summary

**Required actions before this context MD is used in a session:**
- [ ] [specific section to update]
- [ ] [specific file to add/remove from Key Files]
- [ ] [specific dependency to add]
- [ ] Update last_verified_sprint to [current sprint]

---

### CONTEXT-HEALTH.md Row (copy-paste ready)

| [module] | [module].context.md | [current sprint] | [owner from MD] | [status emoji] [CLEAN/STALE/OUTDATED] |
```

---

## Status Definitions

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **CLEAN ✅** | All 5 checks pass |
| **STALE ⚠️** | 1-2 checks fail (update before next developer session) |
| **OUTDATED ❌** | 3+ checks fail (do not use as session context until fully updated) |

---

## Behavior Rules

- **Never report CLEAN if any check fails** — even one failure is STALE minimum
- **Never guess the module path** — if resolution fails, stop and ask
- **Always provide the CONTEXT-HEALTH.md row** — copy-paste ready, even on CLEAN audits
- **Check 4 is best-effort** — if the module has 10+ files, add "(limited scan)" to the check result
- **One module per audit run** — do not batch across modules in a single session
- **If `CONTEXT-HEALTH.md` is missing**, output a starter template at the end:

```
# CONTEXT-HEALTH.md — [Project Name]
Last reviewed: [current sprint]

| Module | Context MD | Last Verified | Owner | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|
| [module] | [module].context.md | [current sprint] | [owner] | [status] |
```
